# BetterBeerBrowsings
Project 1 for Analytics Bootcamp

## Beer Charter

### The kind of data you'd like to work with/field you're interested in (e.g., geodata, weather data, etc.)
Beer data, specifically:
* Breweries per capita
* Beer distribution
     * Brewery size compared to furthest distance beer sold out of original zip code
* Beer popularity by type, season, and location
* Breweries and crime
     * Breweries and DUIs
     * DUIs versus violent crime by zip code

### The kinds of questions you'll be asking of that data
* Which zip codes are the most popular for drinking beer? (Measured by highest number of breweries per capita)
* How far of a geographic reach does the average brewery have? 
* How far are they able to distribute beer? As revenue increases, are breweries able to sell their beer in 
     * 1) more markets (measured by volume)?
     * 2) to a wider geographic scope (measured by 1- distance from further-sold beerâ€™s zip code and main brewery location and 2- number of distribution centers)?
* Are different types of beer more popular in different areas?
* Are different types of beer more popular during different seasons?
* Do breweries have an influence on crime?
     * Do DUIs have a direct correlation with breweries per capita?
     * Are there a higher amount of Lyft/Uber rides in that area? 
     * How do DUIs by zip code compare to violent crime by zip code?
